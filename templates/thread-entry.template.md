# Thread Entry Pattern

This file documents the inline format used inside `sidecar/threads.md`.
It is not a standalone lore file and does not use YAML frontmatter.

## Required Format

`**[ENTITY A]** -> **[ENTITY B]** | [Relationship type]: [Description, 1-2 sentences]. *Relevant entries: [type:slug, type:slug]*`

## Instructional Example

`**[PC Name]** -> **[Faction or Location]** | [Connection type]: [How this campaign relationship currently functions and why it matters]. *Relevant entries: [npc:example-pc, faction:example-group]*`

## Usage Guidance

- Use threads for campaign-specific ties, tensions, debts, agendas, and obligations.
- Keep the statement actionable for session prep; avoid broad encyclopedia content.
- Favor present-tense phrasing that reflects current campaign state.
- Include `Relevant entries:` slugs that anchor the thread to canonical records.
- For full conventions and maintenance rules, see `templates/GUIDE.md`.

## Threads vs Canonical Lore

- Threads are volatile and campaign-specific; update frequently as sessions evolve.
- Canonical lore in `lore/` stores stable world truth and should not be rewritten each session.
