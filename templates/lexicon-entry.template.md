# Lexicon Entry Pattern

This file documents the inline format used inside `sidecar/lexicon.md`.
It is not a standalone lore file and does not use YAML frontmatter.

## Required Format

`**[TERM]** - [Definition, 15-30 words max]. *See: [type:slug if applicable]*`

## Instructional Example

`**[Example Term]** - [Brief in-universe definition that explains usage and context]. *See: [faction:example-slug]*`

## Usage Guidance

- Use lexicon entries for vocabulary, jargon, doctrine labels, and short concepts.
- Keep entries compact and unambiguous; avoid narrative history.
- Use sentence case in definitions and title case for term labels when appropriate.
- Include `See:` only when a canonical entry exists and materially clarifies the term.
- For complete guidance and promotion rules, see `templates/GUIDE.md`.

## Lexicon vs Full Entry

- Choose lexicon when the concept can be explained in one sentence without timeline or relationship depth.
- Promote to a full Tier 3 entry when the concept needs history, stakeholders, conflict, or recurring campaign impact.
